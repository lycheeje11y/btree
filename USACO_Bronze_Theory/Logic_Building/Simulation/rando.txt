This question has the same scenario as Board Game and will assume you have an understanding of that question.
In Dice Game, the player will roll a D sided dice to determine their starting position on the board.
So, if the player is using a 4 sided dice, they may start potentially at position 1 or up to position 4 initially and start their game from there.
Input Format
The first line will contain N and M.
The second line will contain N space separated integers, indicating the board state.
The next M lines will contain an integer, denoting a D sided dice. D is guaranteed to be between 1 and N inclusive.
Output Format
For each die, print how many outcomes of each dice will allow the player to win.
Example

1 3 2 4 2 4 5 0

If the player uses a 4 sided dice...
Starting from position 1: No
Starting from position 2: No
Starting from position 3: No
Starting from position 4: Yes
